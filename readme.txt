Step1 : Firstly the finger is captured by the webcamera under IR light transmission. 
Step 2:  The dataset is collected and loaded which is used for traning, testing and validating
Step 3: The images from the Testing Dataset undergo feature extraction process to extract all the required features to analyze the image and to produce the appropriate result
Step 4: Then these data will be processed further for the feature selection and the system is trained using deep learning algorithm
Step 5: Once training is complete, the system is ready for authenticating the users.
